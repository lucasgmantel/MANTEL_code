# Python Project : Solvent-Accesibility Surface Area of a protein

### Project Presentation 


This project implements a Python script (`sasa.py`) to calculate the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) and the Relative Solvent Accessibility (RSA) per residue of a given protein. The method is based on Shrake and Rupley’s algorithm, which uses 92 uniformly distributed points on a sphere to model the atomic surface. The script also compares results with FreeSASA (a reference library) and generates a bar plot to visualize RSA values per residue using both FreeSASA and the implemented algorithm.

**Key Features :**
- Computes SASA and RSA for each residue in a PDB file
- Uses a sphere of 92 points (Saff & Kuijlaars) for surface modelin
- Compares results with those computed by FreeSASA
- Saves a by residue comparison plot in the `./results` directory

The 92 points of the sphere were generated by the `sph_saff.py` script. This script generates the 92 points using the Saff & Kuiljaars algorithm and writes their (x, y, z) coordinates in the `sphere.txt` file. The `anti_lib.py` script is necessary for the `sph_saff.py` script to run. These scripts were used independently from our main script. The latter extracts the points coordinates from the `sphere.txt` file to generate the spheres modeling the atoms.

The `sasa.py` script was run on 3 protein structures to evaluate its performance: the lysozyme (PDB code: 1AKI), the barstar (PDB code: 1BTA) and the insulin (PDB code: 3I40). The barplots generated for each structure were saved in the `./results` directory so you can have a look at the results.
